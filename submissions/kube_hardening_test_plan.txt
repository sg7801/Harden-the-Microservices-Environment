We must not directly apply changes directly to the production environment for hardening the Kubernetes cluster. There should be a test environment used for testing them before applying them. We must test them rigorously in order to make sure that they do not break environment when applied. After testing, immediately roll them into production environment. Alternatively, we can create a new deployment with required changes and roll it out as well. Once its rolled out, it should be promoted to the production environment after it is successfully tested.
